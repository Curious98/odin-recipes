<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Doughnuts without holes! This is a traditional Jewish holiday recipe; sufganiyot are commonly served during the Hanukkah season.
We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 cups self-rising flour</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 cup cocktail peanuts</li>
  <li>2 (8 ounce) containers yogurt</li>
  <li>2 Tablespoons white sugar</li>  
  <li>1 pinch salt</li>
  <li>2 tablespoon vanilla sugar</li>
  <li>3 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Combine flour, eggs, yogurt, sugar, salt and vanilla sugar in a large mixing bowl. Mix well. Set the dough aside for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Form the dough into balls with a 2-inch diameter.</li>
  <li>Heat the vegetable oil to 365 degrees F (190 degrees C) in a large pot or deep fryer over high heat. It is best to use a basket or slotted spoon for deep frying the sufganiyot, as the oil will be extremely hot. Deep fry the dough in the oil. Let the sufganiyot cool and drain on paper towels.</li>
